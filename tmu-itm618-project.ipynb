    "You can use the 10 Year-3 Month Treasury Yield Spread, which is the difference between the ten-year treasury rate and the three-month treasury rate. This spread is widely used as a gauge to study the yield curve. A 10-year-3-month treasury spread that approaches 0 signifies a \"flattening\" yield curve. Furthermore, a negative 10-year-3-month spread has historically been viewed as a precursor or predictor of a recessionary period. The New York Fed uses the rate in a model to predict recessions 2 to 6 quarters ahead."
